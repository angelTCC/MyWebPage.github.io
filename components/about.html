      <p>ðŸ‘‹ <strong>Hi, I'm Angel Chaico!</strong> I fuse <strong>AI, backend development, physics, and agriculture</strong> to solve real-world problems through technology. 
        I hold a <strong>B.Sc. in Physics (UNI)</strong> and recently began studying <strong>Agricultural Engineering at UNALM</strong>, with a focus on tech-driven solutions for farming.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        My foundation in science and programming allows me to quickly apply tools like <strong>machine learning, APIs, GIS, and computer vision</strong> to agricultural use cases. 
        Though new to the field, Iâ€™m already building projects in <strong>crop prediction, irrigation systems, and farm data management</strong>.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        Iâ€™m self-taught in technologies like <strong>Django, FastAPI, React, Flask, and TensorFlow</strong>, and I enjoy learning by building. 
      </p>
    
      <p>ðŸš€ I'm building a strong <strong>portfolio</strong> and a personal <strong>Learning Hub</strong> to document and share my journey into agricultural technology. Letâ€™s connect!</p>
